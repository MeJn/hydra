      # name of the Nevergrad optimizer to use. Here is a sample:
      #   - "OnePlusOne" extremely simple and robust, especially at low budget, but
      #     tends to converge early.
      #   - "CMA" very good algorithm, but may require a significant budget (> 120)
      #   - "TwoPointsDE": an algorithm good in a wide range of settings, for significant 
      #     budgets (> 120).
      #   - "Shiva" an algorithm aiming at identifying the best optimizer given your input
      #     definition (work in progress, it may still be ill-suited for low budget)
      optimizer: OnePlusOne
      # number of parallel function evaluations to perform
